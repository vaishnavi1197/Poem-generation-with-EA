# Poem-generation-with-EA

I am creating this repo for us to edit code and keep everyone updated.
I am using EA.ipynb with Trial_data.txt and Dataset_poems.txt

# 3/31/2022: 
## Basic functions created
 select_random_words = selects random words
 
 create_poems = merge 4 words to string to get poem like structure
 
 store_syllables = saves the sum of syllables in each verse
